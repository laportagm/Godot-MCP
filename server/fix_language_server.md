# Fix for GDScript Language Server Error

## Error:
```
ERROR: Condition "!thread.is_started()" is true.
at: stop (modules/gdscript/language_server/gdscript_language_server.cpp:111)
```

## Solutions (try in order):

### 1. Restart Godot Editor
Close and reopen the Godot editor. This often resolves language server thread issues.

### 2. Clear Editor Cache
```bash
# On macOS, clear Godot editor cache:
rm -rf ~/Library/Caches/Godot/
rm -rf ~/Library/Application\ Support/Godot/
```

### 3. Check for Syntax Errors
Run Godot in verbose mode to check for any syntax errors:
```bash
/Applications/Godot.app/Contents/MacOS/Godot --path /Users/gagelaporta/Desktop/NeuroVision-Repo --verbose
```

### 4. Disable Language Server (temporary)
In Godot Editor:
- Editor → Editor Settings → Network → Language Server
- Disable "Enable Language Server"
- Restart Godot
- Re-enable it after the editor loads successfully

### 5. Check Project Settings
Ensure project.godot doesn't have corrupted entries:
```bash
# Backup project.godot first
cp project.godot project.godot.backup

# Check for any malformed entries
grep -E "^[[:space:]]*$|^[^=]+$" project.godot
```

### 6. Safe Mode Launch
Launch Godot in safe mode to bypass certain initializations:
```bash
/Applications/Godot.app/Contents/MacOS/Godot --path /Users/gagelaporta/Desktop/NeuroVision-Repo --safe-mode
```

## Prevention:
- Always close Godot properly (don't force quit)
- Wait for language server to fully initialize before closing
- Keep Godot updated to the latest stable version

## Note:
This error is typically harmless and doesn't affect your project files. It's an internal Godot editor issue related to thread management in the language server component.
