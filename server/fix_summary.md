# Fix Summary for NeuroVision Errors

## Issues Fixed:

### 1. Parse Error in QuizPanel.gd (line 390)
**Error**: `Parse Error: Function`
**Cause**: Called `_create_focus_style()` instead of `_create_m3_focus_style()`
**Fix**: Changed line 390 to use the correct method name `_create_m3_focus_style()`

### 2. Missing QuizPanel Type Declaration
**Error**: `Could not find type "QuizPanel" in the current scope`
**Cause**: QuizPanel.gd didn't have a class_name declaration
**Fix**: Added `class_name QuizPanel` at the top of QuizPanel.gd

### 3. Godot Detecting Another project.godot
**Warning**: `Detected another project.godot at res://godot-mcp`
**Cause**: The godot-mcp folder contains a project.godot file for MCP server development
**Fix**: Created a `.gdignore` file in the godot-mcp folder to exclude it from Godot's scanning

### 4. Metal LOD Bias Warning
**Warning**: `Metal does not support LOD bias for samplers`
**Note**: This is a platform-specific limitation when running Godot on macOS with Metal renderer. It's harmless and doesn't affect functionality.

## Files Modified:
1. `/src/ui/components/QuizPanel.gd` - Fixed method name and added class_name
2. `/godot-mcp/.gdignore` - Created to ignore MCP server folder

## Result:
All errors should now be resolved. The QuizPanel will load correctly and be available as a type in EnhancedExplorationScene.
